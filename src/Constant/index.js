export const secondPageParagraph = `I'm a 14-year-old Indian developer 🇮🇳, driven by tech passion and curiosity. My coding journey began in 5th grade, guided by my uncle. Since then, I've built a diverse skill set.

Started with HTML & CSS 🎨, leveled up with Sass, then dove into JavaScript and TypeScript 🛡️. React brought modular magic 🚀, and Next.js boosted performance 🌐. 

Mastered C, C++, and Python 🖥️—C for low-level skills, C++ for object-oriented concepts, and Python for quick, versatile coding.

For me, programming isn’t just coding; it’s creating, solving problems, and pushing boundaries 💡. At 14, my journey has just begun, and I’m excited for what’s next 🌍.`;
